# 506-practice-workflow
this is a primer for 504/507 fall semester classes to practice a basic development workflow 

the variables created include age (of the student), name (of the student), grades_list (of the student), and my_dict (a short profile of the student) 

the function takes two grades and calculates them to find out whether or not the student's average grade is passing or failing. A passing grade is an average of 70 or above. the arguments included are grade1 and grade2. the return statement will return a message indicating whether the student has passed or not. 
the expected output for print(calculate_grade(95,68)) is "You have passed your ahi classes for the summer semester, congrats!"
the expected output for print(calculate_grade(46,71)) is "You did not pass your ahi classes. Try again next summer!"
